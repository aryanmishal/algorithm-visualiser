🚀 Algorithm Visualiser
📝 Overview
A web/desktop application that enables users to visualize the step-by-step execution of classic algorithms (like sorting, pathfinding, graph traversal, etc.). The goal is to deepen understanding through interactive and animated demonstrations.

🔧 Features
Visualizes algorithms such as:

Sorting: Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap, etc.
Pathfinding: Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS.
Step-by-step playback controls (play, pause, step forward/backward).

Adjustable input set (random arrays, custom grids/graphs).

Color-coded animation reflecting algorithm states.

Performance metrics display (comparisons, swaps, visited nodes).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: (e.g.) React, Vue.js, plain JavaScript + Canvas/SVG.
Backend (optional): Node.js server or Python Flask API to run heavy computations.
Styles: CSS / Tailwind / Bootstrap.
🎯 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+)
npm or yarn
Python (if using backend)
Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualiser.git
cd algorithm-visualiser
npm install
# If backend:
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
Running Locally
Frontend only:

npm start
With backend:

# In frontend directory
npm run dev
# In backend directory
python app.py
Open http://localhost:3000 (or backend-enabled endpoint) in your browser.

📦 Usage
Choose an algorithm from the sidebar/menu.
Customize input data where applicable (size, complexity).
Hit "Play" to watch the animation.
Use step controls to move through the algorithm manually.
Observe statistics and execution flow.
🧠 Extending & Contributing
Add new algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy).
Support multiple languages/backends.
Improve UI/UX with sliders, themes, or tutorials.
Enhance performance with Web Workers or optimized rendering.
Contributions welcome! See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.
✅ A Simple Example
// Pseudocode visualization event firing
function visualizeSwap(i, j) {
  drawArray(currentArray);
  highlightBars(i, j);
  // pause for animation
}

🎥 Starter Video Guide
I found a great Sorting Visualizer tutorial that walks through building a Merge Sort animation from scratch. It’s ideal for learning core concepts and extending the project further:

Sorting Visualizer Tutorial – Merge Sort Walkthrough (by pFXYym4Wbkc)

Why it’s helpful:
Implements visualization logic clearly and concisely.
Covers UI updates, animation timing, and algorithm integration.
perfect springboard for adding your own algorithms or tweaking the interface.
✅ Next Steps
Watch the tutorial and build the basic visualizer.
Recreate the core structure in your own project.
Pick an algorithm not covered (like A*, DFS, or Heap Sort) and implement it using your framework.
Add interactive controls and performance metrics.
Consider open-sourcing your version—others may contribute!
